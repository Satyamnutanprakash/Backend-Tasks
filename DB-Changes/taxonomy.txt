Taxonomy

- The main database tables involved in handling taxonomy data:

	• taxonomy_index: This table maintains the relationship between terms and content 
		(nodes or other entities) that are tagged with those terms. It's used to efficiently query 
		and retrieve content based on their taxonomy terms.

	• taxonomy_term_data: This table stores basic information about each term, such as 
		term ID, Vocabulary ID(vid), revision ID, uuid. It represents the terms themselves 
		and their hierarchical structure.

	• taxonomy_term_revision: This table stores information for the revision data table for 
		taxonomy_term entities, also about each vocabulary, such as term ID(tid), revision ID,
		timestamp(revision created), and other settings related to the vocabulary.

	• taxonomy_term_hierarchy: This table stores the hierarchical relationships between
		terms. Each row represents a parent-child relationship between terms and is used to 
		build and traverse the term hierarchy.

	• taxonomy_field_data: This table stores information for taxonomy_term entities, about each 
		vocabulary, such as term ID(tid), revision ID, vocabulary ID, name, timestamp(changed),
		and other settings related to the vocabulary.

	• taxonomy_field_revision: This table stores information for the revision data table for 
		taxonomy_term entities, also about each vocabulary, such as term ID(tid), revision ID,
		vocabulary ID, name, timestamp(changed), and other settings related to the vocabulary.



- When you perform different operations on taxonomy terms, here's how the tables are 
affected:

	• Creating a Term: When you create a new taxonomy term, an entry is added to the 
		taxonomy_term_data table with the term's basic information. If the term has a parent
		term, a corresponding entry is also added to the taxonomy_term_hierarchy table to 
		establish the hierarchical relationship.

	• Updating a Term: When you update an existing term's information, the relevant fields 
		in the taxonomy_term_data table are updated.

	• Deleting a Term: When you delete a taxonomy term, the corresponding rows in the 
		taxonomy_term_data, taxonomy_term_hierarchy, and taxonomy_index tables are 
		typically removed.

	• Tagging Content with Terms: When you associate content (nodes or entities) with 
		taxonomy terms, entries are added to the taxonomy_index table, linking the content 
		to the appropriate terms.

	• Querying Content by Terms: When you query for content based on taxonomy terms, 
		the taxonomy_index table is used to efficiently retrieve the relevant content items.
